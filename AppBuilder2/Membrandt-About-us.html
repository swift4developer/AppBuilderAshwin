First and foremost, I just want to welcome you and say thank you. No matter how you found your way here, if it was through a referral, if it was through my book and the bonus to the book, and that's what led you here, honestly, it doesn't matter to me. I'm just happy you're here. You'll find I'm a pretty easy-going guy, and I love to create a bunch of great content for you. So, I'm looking forward to you checking out what we've got to offer you here. Now, if you haven't gotten a copy of my book yet, you can absolutely pick one up here at the link on the screen below at get.ismastery.com, and that'll give you a chance to pick up a copy of it. </div><div class="bp1-i-also-wanted-to-let">I also wanted to let you know that coming very shortly, I'll be adding an audio version and also a workbook. The audio narration is already complete. Just getting it published up on audible.com, so that'll be available very soon. I'm also creating a workbook from the book content as well, so it'll help you go through the different sections and just kind of create tasks and a checklist of the things that you need to do to knock them off, because I know there's a lot of meat and a lot of content in the book for you. After that, I want to make sure that you have a chance to check out Mastering Campaign Builder. </div><div class="bp1-now-this-course-tha-copy">Now, this course that you may have seen or may not have, but if you haven't had a chance to check it out, please go to the link below and take a look at everything there in the sales page. This is really all of my best practices, everything from the last 10 years that I've learned. It's all my best stuff. Nothing is held back. All of this content is new and fresh and has been created in just the last couple or three months. So this is not something that's been stagnant, or, you know, three years ago this course was created or anything like that. This is all new and fresh and up to the minute. Great stuff with Infusionsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div class="bp1-and-just-so-you-know">And just so you know, there's absolutely no risk in you giving this course a shot, because I absolutely guarantee that you will love it. And if you don't, within the first 60 days, just let me know, and I'll give you your money back, because honestly, if you don't love this course and see the tremendous value, then I just don't even want your money. I mean, it's really that simple. I've got to tell you, I've never had a single refund on this entire course. So, that should speak volumes. All right. Well now let's jump in now and take a look at a quick demo of how to get the most out of your free trainings available in the Infusionsoft <br>Mastery site. </div><div class="bp1-okay-so-lets-take">Okay. So, let's take a quick little walkthrough of the membership site, so that you can see what there is there waiting for you, and how to access it, et cetera. So, first of all, there's this menu down here on the left-hand side for navigation. This is your main area where the content is that you'll find. And then, also, here are some additional little things&nbsp;&nbsp;that you'll see that will be contextual based on where you are in the membership. Now, to access the free book links, you'll come in here to the book links, and that will bring you into here. This is all done inside a learning environment. </div><div class="bp1-so-you-can-click-her">So you can click here and open up the book links, and it'll give you all the different courses. All of this is included for free. And trust me, this is not just cheesy stuff. This is truly worth two to three to four hundred dollars in value. I've had lot of people tell me that this course alone, all of the free videos, are worth way more value than the $200 I claim on the book itself. So, don't take this for granted as just free content. There's some really good stuff here. If you're not using this optional confirmation process, for example, I highly, highly recommend it. So, take some time, go through the videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div class="bp1-when-you-go-through">When you go through the videos, you'll notice this one's checked off and these others aren't. So, what you can do is when you go through and watch one of these videos, and after you've completed the video, you can go through down here at the bottom. This one's even got HTML source content. I can say I'm done with this, so let's go ahead and mark this one complete. When we do that, you'll notice that now, it's marked up here complete. If we go back and look at all of the book links and drill in, you'll see that it's marked complete here as well. If we go back there, you'll also see that it tells you your progress here in this progress bar that we're step 2 of 12 through there. We've completed 2 of the 12 videos, okay?&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div class="bp1-now-another-thing-i">Now, another thing I really want to show you and make sure that you recognize, because this is super convenient and nice. See this little "TAKE NOTES" down here? You can click on that, and that's going to pop up this little window, where you can take any notes you want, and this window stays. So, even if the video's playing, even if I'm scrolling around here and looking on, this window stays visible so that you can take notes on the course. These notes are saved. You can save them <br>right here, and they stay with you. So, when you log in, you've got all of your notes from the previous lessons, et cetera, and you can print them out, or you can just download them straight to a Word document. </div><div class="bp1-and-so-you-see-the">And so, you see the download there, and I can just pull this up, and it'll pull it up in word, and you can see it preserves formatting and lengths and everything in there. So, this is very, very useful, and I want to make sure that you're aware of that, because some people don't see that in there. All right. So, that is just a quick overview. Also, there's news and updates. As I release new things, you'll see those released in here. You can explore our products and services. I would highly encourage you to do so. If you need virtual assistance with Infusionsoft, we have a team. These are not outsourced/overseas people. </div><div class="bp1-everybody-on-my-team">Everybody on my team is personally trained by me, and they're a certified partner with Infusionsoft as well. So, everybody on my team is highly trained and specialized. And while we're not the cheapest out there, we're very, very affordable. What you'll find is that we do it right, and we get it done faster. So honestly, in many cases, we end up being cheaper in the long run. I've had many clients that are paying $25 an hour to somebody that doesn't really know what they're doing and ends up spending a lot more per month with somebody that doesn't know what they're doing and actually gets terrible results as well, as opposed to paying us a little bit more money and get it done <br>right the first time. </div><div class="bp1-so-if-you-need-virt">So, if you need virtual assistance, make sure and reach out. The automated club is my print newsletter, and this is an awesome print newsletter that is just a high quality, color, 24-page print newsletter every month that comes to your doorstep. So, not digital, and it's not available digital. Please don't ask. I do not make this available digitally under any circumstances. However, it's awesome for print resource. There's reasons behind that. I want people to have this to hold it, to read it, to go back to it. The trainings that I put into this newsletter are <br>super valuable that can be used and referred back to many times. </div><div class="bp1-so-i-want-you-to-hav">So I want you to have that collection on the bookshelf and enjoy being able to pull them down and read them. As you sit in line at the bank or anything else, you've got it with you to take with you. The other thing that I want to make sure that you're aware is my Inner Circle. The Inner Circle is tremendous value. I highly recommend you at least consider or take a look at it. I feel that this is the strongest offering in the marketplace. It's more than just group coaching with Infusionsoft, although that's part of its main core focus. We get on a call every week, with me personally, for two hours or more of my time, sometimes two and a half hours, and we attend everybody that's on the call and help them out with all the stuff that they got going on. </div><div class="bp1-what-youre-going-to">What you're going to find is that beyond just Infusionsoft guidance, it is guidance for your small business and practices and dealing with overwhelm and having an accountability partner. So, part of this process is you'll have goals that you set weekly and get responses from me on an accountability of them. It's very hands-on, very high-touch and tremendous value at only $299 a month. You'll also get what I call Funnel Fridays. Funnel Fridays is I make my tech team available to you on Friday, and any questions that you have regarding setting up funnels with Infusionsoft, whether you need help with MyFusion Helper or lead pages or Thrive Themes or Memberium, any of those types of related products that all kind of comprise putting a funnel together, because we all know that a funnel is more than just the Infusionsoft piece. </div><div class="bp1-if-you-need-that-tec">If you need that tech assistance, you can show up on Funnel Fridays and get assistance with that. Lastly, it's even got Facebook ads training. This is not digital training that you just watch the videos. This is live, show up, and I paid a bunch of money to have a trusted advisor that runs a boutique Facebook ads agency. His name's John Sanpietro, and he will be hosting those live trainings twice a month with you as well, and they're not trainings in the sense of walking through a bunch of stuff. What they really are is QA for you to show up, and show them your campaigns, what you're struggling with, what you need some help with. </div><div class="bp1-hell-also-at-the">He'll, also, at the top of the hour, give you some news and updates on what's working best for his clients in Facebook right now, and all of the greatest news, and related changes as Facebook is making changes all the time. So, all of that you get inside of the Inner Circle, plus you also get the print newsletter. The Automation Club is included for free, with people in the Inner Circle. I also send you out additional print books every single month. There's a ton of value for the $299 monthly <br>subscription. I didn't even mention the fact that you also get access to my other trainings, like my $500 mastering campaign builder training and the other trainings that are being created right now, as well as access to my campaigns. </div><div class="bp1-some-of-those-campai">Some of those campaigns are as expensive as $799, and you'll get them in the $299 monthly, with the Inner Circle. So, as you can tell, the amount of value that I pack into this program is intentional, because I want you to be there and work with me for months to come and really ramp up your Infusionsoft business. There are just a couple of other things that you'll want to do as well. You want to explore the tools and resources area. If you're not familiar with some of our other products — MyFusion Helper or SimpleCart.io or MyFusion Notes. Thrive Themes is not our product, but this is a tool that we highly recommend and we use on all of our sites. So, Thrive Themes is also listed here, and you can check those out as well. </div><div class="bp1-all-right-thank-you">All right. Thank you so much. Make sure, as you're watching your trainings, if you have questions or comments, make them in the comment section, and we're hyper responsive to reply to those as well. All right. So that is a wrap here. You've had a chance to see the site, learn about my book, where you can get a copy if you haven't already, and also, about Infusionsoft Mastery. Take your time, go through everything, and don't be a stranger. If you need any help, make sure and reach out to me at troy@ismastery.com.

All of this is included for free. And trust me, this is not just cheesy stuff. This is truly worth two to three to four hundred dollars in value. I've had lot of people tell me that this course alone, all of the free videos, are worth way more value than the $200 I claim on the book itself. So, don't take this for granted as just free content. There's some really good stuff here. If you're not using this optional confirmation process, for example, I highly, highly recommend it. So, take some time, go through the videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div class="bp3-when-you-go-through">When you go through the videos, you'll notice this one's checked off and these others aren't. So, what you can do is when you go through and watch one of these videos, and after you've completed the video, you can go through down here at the bottom. This one's even got HTML source content. I can say I'm done with this, so let's go ahead and mark this one complete. When we do that, you'll notice that now, it's marked up here complete. If we go back and look at all of the book links and drill in, you'll see that it's marked complete here as well. If we go back there, you'll also see that it tells you your progress here in this progress bar that we're step 2 of 12 through there. We've completed 2 of the 12 videos, okay?&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div class="bp3-now-another-thing-i">Now, another thing I really want to show you and make sure that you recognize, because this is super convenient and nice. See this little "TAKE NOTES" down here? You can click on that, and that's going to pop up this little window, where you can take any notes you want, and this window stays. So, even if the video's playing, even if I'm scrolling around here and looking on, this window stays visible so that you can take notes on the course. These notes are saved. You can save them right here, and they stay with you. So, when you log in, you've got all of your notes from the previous lessons, et cetera, and you can print them out, or you can just download them straight to a Word document. </div><div class="bp3-and-so-you-see-the">And so, you see the download there, and I can just pull this up, and it'll pull it up in word, and you can see it preserves formatting and lengths and everything in there. So, this is very, very useful, and I want to make sure that you're aware of that, because some people don't see that in there. All right. So, that is just a quick overview. Also, there's news and updates. As I release new things, you'll see those released in here. You can explore our products and services. I would highly encourage you to do so. If you need virtual assistance with Infusionsoft, we have a team. These are not outsourced/overseas people. </div><div class="bp3-everybody-on-my-team">Everybody on my team is personally trained by me, and they're a certified partner with Infusionsoft as well. So, everybody on my team is highly trained and specialized. And while we're not the cheapest out there, we're very, very affordable. What you'll find is that we do it right, and we get it done faster. So honestly, in many cases, we end up being cheaper in the long run. I've had many clients that are paying $25 an hour to somebody that doesn't really know what they're doing and ends up spending a lot more per month with somebody that doesn't know what they're doing and actually gets terrible results as well, as opposed to paying us a little bit more money and get it done right the first time. </div><div class="bp3-so-if-you-need-virt">So, if you need virtual assistance, make sure and reach out. The automated club is my print newsletter, and this is an awesome print newsletter that is just a high quality, color, 24-page print newsletter every month that comes to your doorstep. So, not digital, and it's not available digital. Please don't ask. I do not make this available digitally under any circumstances. However, it's awesome for print resource. There's reasons behind that. I want people to have this to hold it, to read it, to go back to it. The trainings that I put into this newsletter are super valuable that can be used and referred back to many times. </div><div class="bp3-so-i-want-you-to-hav">So I want you to have that collection on the bookshelf and enjoy being able to pull them down and read them. As you sit in line at the bank or anything else, you've got it with you to take with you. The other thing that I want to make sure that you're aware is my Inner Circle. The Inner Circle is tremendous value. I highly recommend you at least consider or take a look at it. I feel that this is the strongest offering in the marketplace. It's more than just group coaching with Infusionsoft, although that's part of its main core focus. We get on a call every week, with me personally, for two hours or more of my time, sometimes two and a half hours, and we attend everybody that's on the call and help them out with all the stuff that they got going on. </div><div class="bp3-what-youre-going-to">What you're going to find is that beyond just Infusionsoft guidance, it is guidance for your small business and practices and dealing with overwhelm and having an accountability partner. So, part of this process is you'll have goals that you set weekly and get responses from me on an accountability of them. It's very hands-on, very high-touch and tremendous value at only $299 a month. You'll also get what I call Funnel Fridays. Funnel Fridays is I make my tech team available to you on Friday, and any questions that you have regarding setting up funnels with Infusionsoft, whether you need help with MyFusion Helper or lead pages or Thrive Themes or Memberium, any of those types of related products that all kind of comprise putting a funnel together, because we all know that a funnel is more than just the Infusionsoft piece. </div><div class="bp3-if-you-need-that-tec">If you need that tech assistance, you can show up on Funnel Fridays and get assistance with that. Lastly, it's even got Facebook ads training. This is not digital training that you just watch the videos. This is live, show up, and I paid a bunch of money to have a trusted advisor that runs a boutique Facebook ads agency. His name's John Sanpietro, and he will be hosting those live trainings twice a month with you as well, and they're not trainings in the sense of walking through a bunch of stuff. What they really are is QA for you to show up, and show them your campaigns, what you're struggling with, what you need some help with. </div><div class="bp3-hell-also-at-the">He'll, also, at the top of the hour, give you some news and updates on what's working best for his clients in Facebook right now, and all of the greatest news, and related changes as Facebook is making changes all the time. So, all of that you get inside of the Inner Circle, plus you also get the print newsletter. The Automation Club is included for free, with people in the Inner Circle. I also send you out additional print books every single month. There's a ton of value for the $299 monthly subscription. I didn't even mention the fact that you also get access to my other trainings, like my $500 mastering campaign builder training and the other trainings that are being created right now, as well as access to my campaigns. </div><div class="bp3-some-of-those-campai">Some of those campaigns are as expensive as $799, and you'll get them in the $299 monthly, with the Inner Circle. So, as you can tell, the amount of value that I pack into this program is intentional, because I want you to be there and work with me for months to come and really ramp up your Infusionsoft business. There are just a couple of other things that you'll want to do as well. You want to explore the tools and resources area. If you're not familiar with some of our other products — MyFusion Helper or SimpleCart.io or MyFusion Notes. Thrive Themes is not our product, but this is a tool that we highly recommend and we use on all of our sites. So, Thrive Themes is also listed here, and you can check those out as well. </div><div class="bp3-all-right-thank-you">All right. Thank you so much. Make sure, as you're watching your trainings, if you have questions or comments, make them in the comment section, and we're hyper responsive to reply to those as well. All right. So that is a wrap here. You've had a chance to see the site, learn about my book, where you can get a copy if you haven't already, and also, about Infusionsoft Mastery. Take your time, go through everything, and don't be a stranger. If you need any help, make sure and reach out to me at troy@ismastery.com.

First and foremost, I just want to welcome you and say thank you. No matter how you found your way here, if it was through a referral, if it was through my book and the bonus to the book, and that's what led you here, honestly, it doesn't matter to me. I'm just happy you're here. You'll find I'm a pretty easy-going guy, and I love to create a bunch of great content for you. So, I'm looking forward to you checking out what we've got to offer you here. Now, if you haven't gotten a copy of my book yet, you can absolutely pick one up here at the link on the screen below at get.ismastery.com, and that'll give you a chance to pick up a copy of it. </div><div class="bp2-i-also-wanted-to-let">I also wanted to let you know that coming very shortly, I'll be adding an audio version and also a workbook. The audio narration is already complete. Just getting it published up on audible.com, so that'll be available very soon. I'm also creating a workbook from the book content as well, so it'll help you go through the different sections and just kind of create tasks and a checklist of the things that you need to do to knock them off, because I know there's a lot of meat and a lot of content in the book for you. After that, I want to make sure that you have a chance to check out Mastering Campaign Builder. </div><div class="bp2-now-this-course-tha-copy">Now, this course that you may have seen or may not have, but if you haven't had a chance to check it out, please go to the link below and take a look at everything there in the sales page. This is really all of my best practices, everything from the last 10 years that I've learned. It's all my best stuff. Nothing is held back. All of this content is new and fresh and has been created in just the last couple or three months. So this is not something that's been stagnant, or, you know, three years ago this course was created or anything like that. This is all new and fresh and up to the minute. Great stuff with Infusionsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div class="bp2-and-just-so-you-know">And just so you know, there's absolutely no risk in you giving this course a shot, because I absolutely guarantee that you will love it. And if you don't, within the first 60 days, just let me know, and I'll give you your money back, because honestly, if you don't love this course and see the tremendous value, then I just don't even want your money. I mean, it's really that simple. I've got to tell you, I've never had a single refund on this entire course. So, that should speak volumes. All right. Well now let's jump in now and take a look at a quick demo of how to get the most out of your free trainings available in the Infusionsoft <br>Mastery site. </div><div class="bp2-okay-so-lets-take">Okay. So, let's take a quick little walkthrough of the membership site, so that you can see what there is there waiting for you, and how to access it, et cetera. So, first of all, there's this menu down here on the left-hand side for navigation. This is your main area where the content is that you'll find.
